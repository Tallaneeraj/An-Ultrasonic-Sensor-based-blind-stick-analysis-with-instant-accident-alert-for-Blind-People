# An-Ultrasonic-Sensor-based-blind-stick-analysis-with-instant-accident-alert-for-Blind-People
The project is about the blind people who can't move without a stick, so we thought of doing a smart stick for blind people which can sense the obstacles and make buzzer sounds so he can move forward with that, in addition to that, we add fire and water sensors it beeps with different intensities to get attention from it. we can use ultrasonic sensors for a variety of obstacles like a pit, wall, drainages, vehicles, people etc . whenever he forgot the stick through his mobile phone with an app on the home screen can speak to it and the stick responds through voice output like 'you forgot me here' with the help of Bluetooth connection. Apart from these things, there may be chances to meet with an accident then we connected vibrate sensor with certain intensity more than usual . If in case the vibrator sensor senses the accident level frequency we set before then it sends msg to relatives through GPS and GSM connected to the Arduino board.
